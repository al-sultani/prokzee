## 🔧 Technical Debt & Code Quality

We acknowledge that some parts of our codebase currently use temporary solutions or "hacky" approaches to get things working. This was a conscious choice to validate features quickly, but we're committed to improving code quality. Here's what we're planning to address:

### Known Issues
- [ ] Refactor proxy connection pooling implementation
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Restructure the request interception pipeline
- [ ] Clean up temporary workarounds in different places in the codebase 

### Code Quality Goals
- [ ] Create tests for the code pieces
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Improve code documentation

We believe in being transparent about these issues and are actively working to resolve them. If you encounter any of these known limitations, rest assured they're on our radar for improvement.
